## 🎯 Training Workflow

### 1. Prepare Data (5-10 min)
```
1. Record your voice (30-120 min)
2. Open: Prepare_Training_Data.ipynb in Colab
3. Upload your recording
4. Download MyVoice.zip
```

### 2. Train Model (20 hours)
```
1. Open: Train_StarGANv2_VC.ipynb in Colab
2. Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU
3. Run all cells
4. Upload MyVoice.zip
5. Wait ~20 hours
6. Download trained model
```

### 3. Use Model (Forever!)
```
1. Extract trained model
2. Use for voice conversion
3. Enjoy award-winning quality!
```

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No GPU detected | Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU |
| Out of memory | Reduce batch_size to 4 or 2 |
| Upload failed | Use Google Drive option instead |
| Training slow | Verify GPU is enabled |
| Disconnected | Download checkpoints, resume later |
