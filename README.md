## üìã Quick Start (5 Minutes!)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Training Data

1. Record your voice (minimum 30 minutes, 1+ hour recommended)
2. Save as WAV file (any sample rate, will be converted to 24kHz)
3. Use the data preparation notebook: [`Prepare_Training_Data.ipynb`](Prepare_Training_Data.ipynb)
4. Download the generated `MyVoice.zip` file

### Step 2: Train on Colab

1. Click the "Open in Colab" button above
2. Enable GPU: **Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU**
3. Run all cells (click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è from top to bottom)
4. Upload your `MyVoice.zip` when prompted
5. Wait ~20 hours (or leave it running overnight)
6. Download your trained model!

### Step 3: Use Your Trained Model

## üéØ What You'll Get

After training, you'll have a voice conversion model that can:

- ‚úÖ Convert any speaker's voice to your voice
- ‚úÖ Preserve emotional content and prosody
- ‚úÖ Work across different languages
- ‚úÖ Maintain high audio quality (24kHz)
- ‚úÖ Run in real-time with GPU

### Quality Metrics (from original paper):
- **MOS (Mean Opinion Score)**: 4.0+ / 5.0
- **Speaker Similarity**: 85%+
- **Naturalness**: Comparable to natural speech

## üìñ Detailed Documentation

### For Beginners:
- [DETAILED_GUIDE.md](DETAILED_GUIDE.md) - Complete walkthrough with screenshots

### For Advanced Users:
- [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Common issues and solutions
- [StarGANv2-VC Original Repo](https://github.com/yl4579/StarGANv2-VC) - Source code

### Training Tips:
- **Data Quality**: Better audio = better results
- **Data Quantity**: 30-60 minutes minimum, 1-2 hours optimal
- **Diversity**: Include different emotions, speaking styles
- **Checkpoints**: Saved every 2 epochs automatically

---

## üîß Requirements

### For Data Preparation:
- Your voice recording (WAV file, 30+ minutes)
- Google Account (for Colab)
- Web browser

### For Training:
- Google Colab account (free tier works!)
- ~124MB upload (your prepared data)
- ~20 hours of Colab runtime (can split into multiple sessions)

### For Inference:
- Trained model checkpoint
- Source audio to convert
- StarGANv2-VC inference setup (see Inference_Demo.ipynb)

---

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Voice Conversion
```python
# After training, convert voice A to your voice
source_audio = "speaker_a.wav"
target_speaker = "your_voice"
output = convert_voice(source_audio, target_speaker)
```

### Example 2: Cross-lingual Conversion
```python
# Works even if source speaks different language!
source_audio = "french_speaker.wav"
output = convert_voice(source_audio, "your_voice")
```

### Example 3: Emotional Transfer
```python
# Preserves emotion and speaking style
source_audio = "angry_speech.wav"
output = convert_voice(source_audio, "your_voice")
# Output: Your voice, angry emotion preserved!
```

## üéì How It Works

StarGANv2-VC uses a sophisticated GAN-based architecture:

1. **Generator**: Converts voice characteristics
2. **Discriminator**: Ensures natural-sounding output
3. **Style Encoder**: Captures speaker identity
4. **ASR Model**: Preserves content/words
5. **F0 Predictor**: Maintains pitch accuracy

### Training Process:
1. Load pretrained VCTK20 model (20 English speakers)
2. Fine-tune on your voice data (transfer learning)
3. Optimize for 150 epochs (~20 hours on GPU)
4. Save checkpoints every 2 epochs
5. Final model achieves award-winning quality!

## üìä Training Timeline

### With Google Colab Free (T4 GPU):

| Epoch | Time | Quality Level |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 0-10 | ~1.5h | Initial adaptation |
| 10-30 | ~4.5h | Good quality |
| 30-50 | ~7.5h | Very good quality |
| 50-75 | ~11h | Excellent quality |
| 75-100 | ~15h | Near-perfect quality |
| **100-150** | **~22h** | **üèÜ Award-winning quality** |

**Note**: Colab Free has 12-hour session limit. You can split training:
- Session 1: Epochs 0-75 (~11 hours)
- Session 2: Epochs 76-150 (~11 hours)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Colab Session Limits:
- **Free Tier**: 12 hours max runtime, 90 min idle timeout
- **Pro Tier**: 24 hours max runtime, longer idle timeout
- **Solution**: Keep tab open, download checkpoints regularly

### Data Privacy:
- Your voice data is uploaded to Google Colab
- Deleted when session ends
- Consider privacy implications
- Don't upload sensitive recordings

### Fair Use:
- Use trained models responsibly
- Don't create deepfakes without consent
- Respect others' voices and identities
